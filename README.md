# Python-Terminal-Game
A fun terminal game that I made. Windows and Mac OS native downloads coming soon.
# How to Run
To play, first you have to download the code. Then, you have to open Terminal or Command Prompt and navigate to TerminalGame.py. Make sure you have python 3 installed, and then type in `python3 TerminalGame.py`. You have now launched the game. This will be made simpler when I make .exe and .apps, so that you just have to double click.
# How to play
When in the game, you will see a square of zeros. Type `n` to move up one page, and `p` to move down one page. If you found the circle, press `f`. If you decide to exit the game, press `e` or any other character or string on the keyboard.

**WARNING**

If you type any string of characters other than the ones coded in, it will exit the game. This is because the game can't tell `ff` is `f` or `nn` is `n`, etc.
